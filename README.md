# Polyhedral Meshes
This project is an implementation of the cut the edge algorithm has been explored by Dr. Roi Porrane.

The paper solve the next problem:

Given a Polyhedral-Mesh, deform its vertices by reserving the Mesh-Planarity property or in simple words, it is still a Polyhedral-Mesh at the output.
